Sitefinity's Amazon S3 Blob Storage Provider  
===================================================

Sitefinity's Amazon S3 Blob Storage Provider is an implementation of a cloud blob storage provider, which stores the binary blob data of Sitefinity's library items on Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3). This document describes how to use the provider.

Note that only the binary data of the items in a library are stored on the remote blob storage. Sitefinity still manages its logical items by library with their regular meta-data properties (title, description etc) in its own database.
